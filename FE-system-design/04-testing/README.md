## Overview & Testing Principles

Testing in FE system design ensures that UI components, business logic, and integration points behave correctly for users. Good FE testing balances speed, coverage, and reliability.

Key principles:

* **Fast and deterministic unit tests** for logic and small components.
* **Integration tests** for component interactions and API contract checks.
* **E2E tests** to validate critical user journeys.
* **Automate the pipeline**: run tests in CI for each PR.
* **Keep tests readable and maintainable** — tests are code too.

---

## Unit Testing

### Purpose

Test individual functions, utilities, and small components in isolation.

### Scope

* Pure JS/TS functions (formatters, validators, helpers).
* React/Vue component behavior where DOM interactions are shallow.
* Component methods, computed properties.

### Tools

* **Jest** (commonly used with React/Next.js) — assertions, mocks, timers.
* **Mocha + Chai** — flexible runner + assertion lib.
* **Jasmine** — older but still used.
* **Testing Library (React Testing Library)** for component-focused unit tests (encourages testing behavior over implementation).

### Best Practices

* Mock external dependencies (HTTP, storage, timers).
* Keep tests small: one assertion intent per test.
* Use descriptive test names and group related tests with `describe()`.
* Prefer behavior-based assertions (what the user sees) rather than implementation details.

### Example (Jest + React Testing Library)

```js
// src/components/__tests__/Button.test.jsx
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import Button from '../Button';

test('calls onClick when clicked', () => {
  const handle = jest.fn();
  render(<Button onClick={handle}>Send</Button>);
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByText('Send'));
  expect(handle).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
});
```

---

## Integration Testing

### Purpose

Test interactions between multiple units/modules to ensure they work together.

### Scope

* Component trees (parent + children).
* Component + local state + context + hooks.
* Frontend + mocked backend contract (API integration with network stubbing).

### Tools

* Jest + Testing Library for component integration.
* **MSW (Mock Service Worker)** for intercepting network requests in tests (works for unit & integration tests).

### Best Practices

* Limit real network calls; use MSW to assert requests and return canned responses.
* Test meaningful flows: form submit → validation → API call → UI update.

### Example

* Render the parent component and confirm that a child component receives props, state updates, and that an API call is made (using MSW).

---

## Functional Testing

### Purpose

Validate features according to functional requirements — often overlaps with integration and E2E tests but focuses on business rules.

### Scope

* Feature acceptance criteria (e.g., "user can reset password").
* Input validation rules, permission checks, major UI flows.

### Tools

* Test cases written in plain language (Gherkin/Cucumber) or implemented as E2E tests (Cypress/Playwright).

### Best Practices

* Link functional tests to user stories or acceptance criteria.
* Maintain a living document (test cases) that maps to product requirements.

---

## Regression Testing

### Purpose

Prevent reintroduction of previously fixed bugs by running previously failing test cases.

### Scope

* A subset of unit/integration/E2E tests covering high-risk areas.

### Tools

* Same as unit/integration/E2E frameworks; in CI, mark a regression suite.

### Best Practices

* Keep a **regression test suite** that runs on release branches or nightly builds.
* Prioritize flaky-test fixes—flaky tests reduce confidence.

---

## Performance Testing

### Purpose

Measure responsiveness, load capacity, and resource usage for the front end.

### Scope

* Page load time, Time to Interactive (TTI), Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), CPU/memory use for SPAs.

### Tools

* **Lighthouse** (Automated site audits).
* **WebPageTest** for advanced performance metrics.
* **k6** / **Artillery** for load testing APIs backing the FE.
* Browser DevTools (Performance profiler).

### Best Practices

* Test representative user flows under realistic network/throttling conditions.
* Automate Lighthouse CI for PRs or nightly runs.
* Measure both client-side render performance and network/API response times.

---

## Accessibility Testing (a11y)

### Purpose

Ensure the UI is usable by people with disabilities and meets WCAG standards.

### Scope

* Keyboard navigation, screen reader semantics, color contrast, focus management.

### Tools

* **axe-core** / **axe-core Jest integration**.
* **axe DevTools** and **Lighthouse** accessibility audits.
* **Pa11y**, **Accessibility Insights**.
* Manual testing with screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver) and keyboard-only usage.

### Best Practices

* Integrate automated a11y checks into unit and integration tests (e.g., run axe on rendered components).
* Include accessibility checks in PR pipelines for new UI.
* Keep accessibility acceptance criteria in stories.

---

## A/B Testing (Experimentation)

### Purpose

Run controlled experiments to determine whether UX changes improve metrics.

### Scope

* Variants of UI elements, flows, copy, or layout tested against user metrics (click rate, conversion).

### Tools

* **Optimizely**, **VWO**, **LaunchDarkly** (feature flags + experimentation), or custom analytics + flags.

### Best Practices

* Define metrics and success criteria before running experiments.
* Use feature flags to roll out and rollback safely.
* Ensure statistical validity (sample size, duration) and be mindful of user segmentation.

---

## End-to-End (E2E) Testing

### Purpose

Validate complete user journeys in an environment close to production.

### Scope

* Critical user flows (signup, login, checkout), third-party integrations, routing, and authentication flows.

### Tools

* **Cypress** — developer-friendly, fast test runner with built-in time travel and network stubbing.
* **Playwright** — cross-browser automation with fast, reliable tests and multi-tab support.
* **Selenium** — older, broad ecosystem.

### Best Practices

* Keep E2E suite focused on a small number of high-value flows.
* Use test data teardown/seed strategies to keep the environment clean.
* Avoid too many UI-level assertions that are brittle; prefer business outcomes.

### Example (Cypress)

```js
// cypress/e2e/login.spec.js
describe('Login flow', () => {
  it('logs in and lands on dashboard', () => {
    cy.visit('/login');
    cy.get('input[name=email]').type('user@example.com');
    cy.get('input[name=password]').type('password123');
    cy.get('button[type=submit]').click();
    cy.url().should('include', '/dashboard');
    cy.contains('Welcome');
  });
});
```

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)

### Purpose

A development workflow where tests are written before implementation: red → green → refactor.

### Workflow

1. Write a failing test that specifies desired behavior.
2. Implement the minimum code to pass the test.
3. Refactor for clarity, keeping tests green.

### Benefits

* Better design (API-first thinking).
* High test coverage over time.
* Faster feedback on regressions.

### Best Practices

* Keep TDD focused on behavior (unit + integration tests for features).
* Use small, frequent iterations.

---

## Test Pyramid & Strategy

* **Unit tests (base):** Many, very fast, deterministic.
* **Integration tests (middle):** Moderate number, validate interactions.
* **E2E tests (top):** Small number, validate critical user paths.

Strategy:

* Favor more tests at the unit level for fast feedback.
* Keep E2E tests stable and limited in scope.
* Use contract tests and MSW to validate API contracts early.

---

## Test Infrastructure & CI Integration

### CI Practices

* Run **unit tests** and **a11y checks** on every PR.
* Run **E2E tests** on merge to a staging branch or nightly.
* Fail the build on new high-severity accessibility violations.

### Example: GitHub Actions (simplified)

```yaml
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v2
        with:
          version: 8
      - run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
      - run: pnpm test -- --ci
  cypress:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: test
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: pnpm install
      - uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5
        with:
          start: pnpm start
          wait-on: 'http://localhost:3000'
```

## Checklists & When to Stop Testing

### PR checklist (tests related)

* [ ] Unit tests added for new logic.
* [ ] Integration tests for component interactions where necessary.
* [ ] E2E tests updated if the change touches user-critical flows.
* [ ] Accessibility checks passed.
* [ ] Performance regression considered for heavy UI changes.

### When to stop

* Tests validate the acceptance criteria and critical regression paths.
* CI passes consistently and flakiness is below an acceptable threshold.
* Business metrics (if any) are being tracked for changes introduced.

## Appendix: Short FAQ

**Q: How many tests are enough?**
A: Focus on covering important logic, common user flows, and regression hotspots. Use the test pyramid as a guide.

**Q: How to avoid flaky tests?**
A: Avoid real network calls, add deterministic seeding for async code, keep timeouts generous but reasonable, and run tests in clean environments.

**Q: Should I test component internals?**
A: Prefer testing component outputs (DOM, events, props) rather than implementation details, so refactors don't break tests.
