- [ ] Optimistic updates  
- [ ] Handling race conditions  

---

## 🚀 4. Performance Design

### 4.1 Rendering Optimization

- [ ] Reconciliation & Virtual DOM  
- [ ] Memoization (useMemo, useCallback)

- [ ] Avoiding unnecessary renders  

### 4.2 Loading Optimization

- [ ] Code Splitting  
- [ ] Lazy Loading Components  
- [ ] Dynamic Imports  
- [ ] Tree Shaking  
- [ ] Image Optimization (Next.js Image, CDN)  

### 4.3 Network Optimization

- [ ] Caching strategies (HTTP, Service Workers)  
- [ ] CDN design  
- [ ] Compression (Gzip, Brotli)  
- [ ] Prefetch, Preconnect, DNS-prefetch  

### 4.4 Core Web Vitals

- [ ] LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)  
- [ ] FID (First Input Delay)  
- [ ] CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)  
- [ ] Tools: Lighthouse, WebPageTest  

---

## 🏗️ 5. System-Level Design

### 5.1 Large-Scale Frontend Systems

- [ ] Micro-frontend architecture  
- [ ] Module Federation (Webpack, Vite Federation)  
- [ ] Communication between micro frontends  
- [ ] Shared dependency management  
- [ ] Independent deployments  

### 5.2 API Design & Integration

- [ ] REST vs GraphQL vs gRPC  
- [ ] Pagination, filtering, caching  
- [ ] API versioning  
- [ ] Error handling patterns  

### 5.3 Event-driven Frontends

- [ ] WebSockets  
- [ ] SSE (Server-Sent Events)  
- [ ] Pub/Sub using Kafka or Redis Streams (frontend perspective)

---

## 🧰 6. Build, Deploy & CI/CD

### 6.1 Build Systems

- [ ] Webpack, Vite, Turbopack comparison  
- [ ] Bundling & Minification  
- [ ] Source Maps  

### 6.2 Continuous Integration

- [ ] Testing pipeline (Jest, Playwright, Cypress)  
- [ ] Linting & Formatting (ESLint, Prettier)  
- [ ] Code Quality Gates (SonarQube, CodeCov)  

### 6.3 Deployment

- [ ] Next.js on Vercel  
- [ ] React on AWS S3 + CloudFront  
- [ ] Containerization (Docker)  
- [ ] CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI)  

---

## 🔒 7. Security in Frontend Design

- [ ] XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)  
- [ ] CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)  
- [ ] Clickjacking  
- [ ] Content Security Policy  
- [ ] Authentication & Authorization (JWT, OAuth2)  
- [ ] Secure localStorage/sessionStorage handling  

---

## 🧠 8. Design System & UI Consistency
