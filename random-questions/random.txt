🚨 Frontend Interviews Are NOT About Basics Anymore 🚨
If you’re a Frontend / React developer, these are the coding-based questions most people ignore — and that’s why they get rejected.

🔥 JavaScript (Tricky Coding Questions)
• Implement debounce & throttle from scratch
• Flatten a deeply nested array (without flat)
• Output-based questions on closures inside loops
• Polyfill for bind, call, apply
• Implement once() function
• Deep clone an object (handle nested objects & arrays)
• Predict output with setTimeout + promises + async/await
• Implement memoization function
• Convert callback-based code to Promise-based

🔥 React (Coding + Real Interview Traps)
• Build a custom hook (useDebounce, usePrevious)
• Prevent unnecessary re-renders in a large component
• Implement search with debounce
• Controlled vs uncontrolled form (code difference)
• Fix infinite re-render caused by useEffect
• Implement lazy loading without breaking SEO
Explain & fix key-related rendering bugs
• Share state between unrelated components (without Redux)

🔥 DOM / Browser (Most Ignored Section)
• Event delegation – implement with example
• Difference between event.target vs event.currentTarget
• Build a modal from scratch (focus trap, ESC close)
• Implement infinite scroll
• Detect click outside a component
• Intersection Observer use case

🔥 DSA for Frontend (YES, It’s Asked!)
• Two Sum (optimized approach)
• Sliding window problems
• String manipulation problems
• LRU Cache (conceptual + coding)
• Debounce search using queue logic



Code splitting isn’t about React.lazy() syntax.
It’s about performance, user experience, and real-world tradeoffs.

In this article, I break down:
• Where code splitting actually helps
• Common mistakes engineers make
• Real metrics from production apps
• How to answer this question at a senior level

If I am taking your React Interview, I’m asking you these 30 questions 100%:

1. What are the limitations of React in building large-scale applications?

2. How does React manage the Virtual DOM, and what are the benefits?

3. Can React Hooks fully replace Redux for state management? Explain why or why not.

4. What are the best practices for managing state in large React applications?

5. How would you optimize performance in a React app with large component trees?

6. Explain React's Strict Mode and its impact on development.

7. How can you prevent unnecessary re-renders in React functional components?

8. Describe the key differences between functional and class components in React.

9. What is the significance of the React Fiber architecture?

10. How does React handle side effects, and how can you manage them effectively?

11. Explain the differences between `useMemo()` and `useCallback()` in React.

12. How would you implement dynamic form handling and validation in React?

13. What is lazy loading in React, and how does it improve application performance?

14. How would you handle errors in a React app, and what is the role of error boundaries?

15. What are the benefits of server-side rendering (SSR) in React applications?

But in actual frontend work, these rarely come up.

What I spend most of my time doing instead:
– Integrating APIs and handling loading, error, and empty states
– Building forms that are intuitive, accessible, and well-validated
– Managing state cleanly as applications scale
– Improving performance and preventing unnecessary re-renders
– Implementing search, filters, pagination, and debouncing
– Designing component structures that are easy to maintain and extend


Some of these topics are frequently asked.
Others quietly separate average answers from strong ones.

Here’s what I’m actively revising 👇

⚙️ Core JavaScript Internals

• Type coercion and implicit conversions
• var, let, const (hoisting, TDZ, reference errors)
• Function hoisting vs variable hoisting

⏳ Async JavaScript & Execution Model

• Event Loop (call stack, microtasks, macrotasks)
• setTimeout / setInterval and how to stop them
• Callbacks and callback hell
• Promises (then, catch, finally, Promise APIs)
• async/await vs promises
• Writing async code in multiple patterns
• Web Workers and off-main-thread execution

🧠 Functions, Scope & Objects

• Closures (real use cases, not theory)
• Currying (normal & infinite)
• IIFE and use cases
• Arrow functions vs normal functions
• this keyword in different contexts
• call, apply, bind
• Shallow vs deep copy
• Object.freeze() vs Object.seal()

🔗 Prototypes, OOP & FP

• Prototypes & prototypal inheritance
• Classes, constructors & super
• Core OOP concepts in JavaScript
• Functional programming vs OOP
• Common design patterns
• SOLID principles explained in JS terms

📦 Arrays, Objects & DOM

• Array methods (map, filter, reduce, forEach)
• for…of vs for…in
• String, object & array utility methods
• DOM vs BOM
• Event bubbling, capturing & delegation

🚀 Performance & Practical Topics

• Debouncing & throttling
• Immutability
• Memory leaks & garbage collection
• Improving JavaScript performance

✨ Extra practice alongside this list:
– Writing polyfills (bind, map, reduce)
– Solving real interview & machine-coding questions
– Explaining answers out loud (this matters more than people think)
